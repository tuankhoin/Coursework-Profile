In this subject, an agent is built to automatically play the board game Yinsh against other teams in an ELO-style tournament.

Our implmentation won the 8th place out of 89 teams, and was one of the very few teams that beat all staff-made agents during that semester (SM1 2022). Further description can be found in the report.

The source code for the agents can be found in `Project Code/agents/` folder.
