Also, here is my documentation to set up MMCV package (and pytorch/CUDA dark magic) on a Jetson Xavier, made while I tried fiddling around in pain. The process was expected to take 1 hour, but ended up taking me half a day, so yeah, this is a fairly good amount of my blood and tears: [cuda.md](https://gist.github.com/tuankhoin/0e63cfd687211a6758ea5cf77611de78) . It might help you a bit, who knows!
