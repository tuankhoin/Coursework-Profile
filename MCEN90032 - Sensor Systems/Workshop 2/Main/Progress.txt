_Orientation: 0,y left,-9.8
_Problem: Slope, unknown magnetic disturbance

GPS:
_Can only record max 1Hz
_Error margin too large, short-distance walking will make very errorneous measurement
_Too long recording time will not be recorded, user had to run to get a reasonable GPS estimation
_Shaky phone during run

Gyro (dead reckoning):
_To init, needs magneto
_Random walk noise (drift)

Magneto:
_Corrupted by magnetic sources -> Calib 1
_Calib 2: Merge with compass data

Kalman with sequential update

Consider 2D only to
_Avoid 'up & down' magnetic field
_2D estimation, no need 3rd axis
_Change represenation axis

Filter:
_Use mag field to correct gyro

Method count:
_Better angle estimation

Step count: Detect steps, also detect walking ranges

Stride estimation by step:
_Better distance estimation
_More discrete, fewer samples -> More imprecise at where requires it, specifically angle turns
